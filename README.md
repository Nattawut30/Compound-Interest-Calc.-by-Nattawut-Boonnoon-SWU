# Compound-Interest-Calc-by-Nattawut-Boonnoon-Srinakharinwirot-University
A small personal school project inspired by Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing. This is a basic project and my first attempt at learning Python. A Python tool to calculate compound interest with decimal time (e.g., 2.5 years). Shows year-by-year growth in tables.

## How to Run
1. Install Python.
2. Download 'Nattawut_CI_Calc_SWU.py.'
3. Run the code.
4. Enter your principal, interest rate, and number of years.
5. Enjoy how your capital grows year by year.
