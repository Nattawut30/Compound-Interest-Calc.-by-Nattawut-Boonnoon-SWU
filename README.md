# Compound Interest Calculator by Nattawut Boonnoon, Srinakharinwirot University
A beginner friendly project inspired by Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing. Enter the principal, interest rate, and time in years to see how your capital grows year by year. This is my first project and first attempt at learning Python programming. A Python tool to calculate compound interest with decimal time (e.g., 2.5 years). Shows year-by-year growth in tables.

## How to Run
1. Install Python.
2. Download 'Nattawut_CI_Calc_SWU.py.'
3. Run the code.
4. Enter your principal, interest rate, and time in years.
5. Enjoy how your capital grows year by year.
